# Logistic_regression_on_titanic_dataset
Data Analysis and Classification on Titanic data set using Logistic regression in Python.

## What is this project?

This project about Data Analysis on titanic data and after anlysis making a classifier for if someone is going to survive or not.

## Content

In the first step I am doing a very quick data exploration and preprocessing on a visual level, plotting some simple plots to understand the data better. Then I've done some data cleaning and built a Classifier that can predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Tools and Packages

In this project following tools and Python packages has been used :
## IDE

### Jupyter Notebooks: 
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

## Package for scientific calculation 

### 1. NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things: a powerful N-dimensional array object. sophisticated (broadcasting) functions.

### 2 .Pandas: 
In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.

## Package for visualization

### Matplotlib: 
It is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

### Seaborn: 
Statistical plotting library built on top of Matplotlib. It is also designed to work very well with pandas dataframes objects.

### Plotly:
Plotly at its core is a data visualization toolbox. Under every plotly graph is a JSON object, which is a dictionary like data structure.
### Cfflinks:
An overview of cufflinks, a library for easy interactive Pandas charting with Plotly

## Machine Learning Library 

### Scikit-learn: 
The machine learning package of Python. Makes implementing ML Algorithms extremely simple.

## Results
The Model built here has a prediction score of 0.79, i.e., we get an average accuracy of 80+%. This is a very good accuracy for starters This can be imporoved by doing some more feature engineering .
